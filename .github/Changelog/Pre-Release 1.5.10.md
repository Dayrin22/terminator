## Changelog
- This Add-On now requires a resource pack and a behaviour pack to activate
> Downloading either the behaviour pack or resource pack only results an error message about incompatible when activating
- Added Minecraft Random Item gamemode (a concept made by Dream for Java Edition on 24/6/2021)
> The concept here in Bedrock Edition is simliar to the original with a little bit of tweaking due to Bedrock Edition limitation.
- Added Minecraft Terminator gamemode
> If you do not have friends you can now play this gamemode yourself with the terminator which is the hunter
> The Terminator Add-On is not included in this Add-On (download seperately)
> The reason why the Terminator Add-On is not included is because more terminator patches is going to release and updating the manhunt addon just for the terminator to be fixed is not that great.
- Various bug fixes
