## Changelog
- Terminator is now able to use the shield

   The shield only disables damage from various causes for now

   To see if the shield is working:
 
   - Equipping and unequipping will display a message in the chat. 
 
     Eg: `[Terminator]  activated shield` and `[Terminator]  deactivated shield`
 
   - A text message will appear in chat if the shield reduces damage from the terminator
 
     Eg: `[Terminator]  Detected hit`
   
- Decreased respawn explode power by 320%
- Fixed terminator's pathfind when its' health is low
- Terminator now ticks 4 chunks around them from 2 chunks
- Modified terminator's respawn event

  Terminator respawn event only appears once, after that terminator will instant respawn

- Modified `/function terminator` and sub command of `/function terminator/kit/`
  
  Spawning a terminator via those commands will also spawn with a nametag
  
  *(Spawning the terminator via spawn egg will not spawn with the nametag)*
  
- Modified `/function terminator/killall`
- Fixed the critical bug that causes Minecraft to crash
