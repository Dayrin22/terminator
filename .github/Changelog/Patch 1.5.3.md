3rd Patch release for Manhunt version 1.5 [BETA]

- Fixed compass `hand_equipped` thingy
- Fixed the bug that you were able to start the game again after finishing playing
- Added compass cooldown
- Fixed `/function start`

If plan goes accordingly, I'll start adding more gamemodes to the addon in an attempt to maintain performance.

If you're running this addon in version 1.17, you now need to activate these 3 experimental options when applying addon
