4th Patch release for Manhunt version 1.5 [BETA]

- Hunter's death message will not display to everyone.
- Error message now shows up when executing `/function start` after finishing the game

If plan goes accordingly, I'll start adding more gamemodes to the addon in an attempt to maintain performance.

If you're running this addon in version 1.17, you now need to activate these 3 experimental options when applying addon
